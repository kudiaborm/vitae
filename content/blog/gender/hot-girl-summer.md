Hot Girl Summer seems to have crept up on us overnight, holding up a mirror to society's face like many memes before it. Hearing the phrase brings to mind a series of themes. A person might think of sun dresses, beaches, bicycles, friends, and cookouts. It could make you think of teenage carelessness, partying, and the like. Hot Girl Summer makes me think of a complete and total self-love. I'll explain.

>  "It's about women and men being unapologetically them, just having a good-ass time, hyping up their friends, doing you."
> <cite>- Megan Thee Stallion</cite>

For those that were as out of the loop as I was, rapper Megan Thee Stallion describes it for us after the meme was born from a recent song of hers. *"It's about women and men being unapologetically them, just having a good-ass time, hyping up their friends, doing you... You definitely have to be a person who can be the life of the party and just a bad bitch"*. I won't comment on the lyrics to the original song, but I do think she describes something beautiful in this statement. To the unsuspecting eye though, it may look like hedonism.

Whether all the Hot Girl Summer we see on social media is lascivious or hedonistic is a fair question to ask. Is there any room for that kind of thing in Christianity? Surely it's unrestraint and nothing short of indulging in the flesh. But is the whole thing bad because of how excess appears?

It's so easy to get caught up! Not in indulgences, but in self-denial as a form of self-control. Even my patron saint, St. Albert the Great writes about *"shutting the door to one's senses"* and loving God in spirit since *"God in truth is a spirit"*. It's a theme that is very common with many theologian saints. They often have a spirituality that is more logical.

As I age I find myself seeing the limits of intellect in understanding God, myself, those around me, and the world. I crave a more affective perspective on things after a long pattern of avoiding emotions. In more recent years of this journey, John Paul II has stirred my heart. In his Theology of the Body, he emphasizes that we are the integration of body and soul. He emphasizes the immense value of the body and the its resurrection, and of the new heaven and earth.

> "God must be in the physical."

Here I will dare to make an abstraction from part of the 5 years of audiences. Through reading I saw a few ideas illuminated in my mind. Earth is physical, our bodies are physical, and our senses perceive the physical. God must be in the physical. To go further, Christ rose to heaven body and soul.  I saw God as not only spirit but also at this very moment a physical body in heaven. We even see another human lifted up into heaven, our Blessed Mother. Her body is in heaven, it is undeniable she loving Christ’s body and Christ her’s.  They are right now loving each other with all their mind, body and soul, including their senses. What is beautiful about spirituality is that this doesn’t negate St. Albert. It adds another dimension to God’s mystery.

If Mary isn’t afraid to love God with her senses, we shouldn’t be afraid to love Him with ours. We can love everything that we can perceive, which is our person and body, the persons and their bodies around us, and the world and cultures in it. I see God in all these things.

Despite all this, denial of the flesh becomes so much the focus that there is no room for the adoration of the body. The word flesh, with its connotation of uncontrolled passion and sin taints the image of our body. It makes us retreat into our souls. It's as if we are afraid of things like Hot Girl Summer because they acknowledge our fleshy body. We see excess of a good and deny its goodness. 

> "Perfection does not consist in this virtue. It is only a help; a disposition; a means though a fitting one, for the attainment of true perfection."
> <cite>- Saint Jerome</cite>

St. Jerome warns us that *"perfection does not consist in this virtue. It is only a help; a disposition; a means though a fitting one, for the attainment of true perfection"*. While the current world has no problem with many sins, it also has no aversion to the body. 

In the midst an often chaotic and empty world people have developed a remarkable ability for self-love. Lifehack culture found itself lacking, looked upon itself and saw its intrinsic value. Hot Girl Summer even goes beyond internal love with a focus on being intentional with quality time in fellowship. It moves away from consumer culture and into experience culture to craft longlasting memories.

Balance is key, but we can't call balance putting all our weight on one side of the scale. Live intentionally in spirit and in body directing love inwardly and outwardly. Let God reside in your heart and you will be able to delight in the physical world without fear of hedonism. We've acquired knowledge of right and wrong, and so we can align our will with the Lord's and enjoy Hot Girl Summer. After all, what is hedonistic about delighting in the sunshine over the joy of receiving life. What about feeling the sun kiss the skin of a God-given body that you love. And about knowing that the same sun is shining down on the friends around you whom you love as well.
