Hot Girl Summer seems to have crept up on us overnight, holding up a mirror to society's face like many memes before it. For those that were as out of the loop as I was, rapper Megan Thee Stallion describes it for us after the meme was born from a recent song of hers *It's about women and men being unapologetically them, just having a good-ass time, hyping up their friends, doing you... You definitely have to be a person who can be the life of the party and just a bad bitch."* I won't comment on the lyrics to the original song But I think that she has described something really beautiful. But to the unsuspecting eye it may just look like hedonism.

Whether or not the acting out of *Hot Girl Summer* we might see on social media is lacivous or hedonistic is a fair question to ask. Is there any room for that kind of thing in christianity? Surely it's unrestraint and nothing short of indulging in the flesh. But is the whole bad because of the expression of its excess?

It's so easy to get caught up! Not in indulgences, but in self-denial as a form of self control. Even my patron saint, St. Albert the Great, whom I love, writes vividly about *shutting the door to one's senses* and *loving God in spirit* as *God in truth is a spirit*. It's a theme that is very common with many more logically minded theologians.

As I age I find myself seeing the limits of intellect in understanding God, myself, those around me, and the world. I crave a more affective perspective on things after a long pattern of avoiding emotions. In the more recent years of this journey John Paul II has deeply stirred my heart. In his Theology of the Body he emphasizes our being as an integration of body and soul. He emphasizes the immense value and resurrection of the body and a new heaven and a new earth.

> "God must be found, then, in the physical."

An abstraction; Earth is physical, our bodies are physical, and our senses perceive the physical. God must be found, then, in the physical. To go further, Christ rose to heaven body and soul. God is therefore in way not soley spirit but also at this very moment a physical body in heaven. We even see another human lifted up into heaven, our Blessed Mother. Her body is in heaven, undeniably loving Christ's and Christ her's.  They are right now loving each other all their mind, body and soul, including their senses. What is beautiful about spirituality is that all this doesn't negate St. Albert. It adds another dimension to God's mystery.

If Mary isn't afraid to love God with her senses, we shouldn't be afraid to love Him with ours. We can love everything that we can perceive, which is our person and body, the persons and their bodies around us, and the world and cultures in it. God is in all of these. 

> "Perfection does not consist in this virtue. It is only a help; a disposition; a means though a fitting one, for the attainment of true perfection."
> <cite>- Saint Jerome</cite>

Despite all this, denial of the flesh becomes so much the focus that there is no room for adoration of the body. The word flesh, with it's connotation of uncontrolled passion and sin, taints our image of our body and we retreat inwardly into our souls. It's as if we are afraid of things like Hot Girl Summer because we see them as inherently sinful because they involve acknowledging our fleshy body. Or perhaps we see excess and imagine the whole thing to be wrong. The denial of the physical forms of fulfilment and the body is called asceticism. St. Jerome warns us; *perfection does not consist in this virtue. It is only a help; a disposition; a means though a fitting one, for the attainment of true perfection.* While admitadely the current world has no problem with many sins, it has no aversion to the flesh. The world has found itself free to bring many people to delight in their bodies without never doing so for fear of crossing the line into indulgence.

Somehow in the midst of what we like to call a chaotic and empty world, people, especially women of color, have developed a remarkable ability for self love.  Our of lifehack and self care culture found itself lacking, looked upon itself and saw it's intrinsic value without all the fluff. Hot Girl Summer even goes beyond ourselves and is abouot being intentional with quality time in fellowship. It moves away from consumption culture and into experience culture in order to craft longlasting memories.

Balance is key, but we can't call balance putting all our weight on one side of the scale. Live intentionally in spirit and in body directing love inwardly and outwardly. Let God reside in your heart and you will be able to delight in the physical world without fear of hedonism. We've aqcuired knowledge of right and wrong, and so we can align our will with the Lord's and enjoy*Hot Girl Summer*. After all, what is hedonistic about delighting in the sunshine over the joy of being given life, or about feeling the sun kiss the skin of a God given body that you love. And about knowing that the same sun is shining down on the friends around you whom you love as well.
