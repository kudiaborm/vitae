Often it can be hard to reconcile how a certain place in life can coexist with a presence of Christ in life. We judge the virtue of individuals, or even  blame them for arriving in some situations. Take the phrase *you must accept Jesus into your heart*. It sounds like a basic need, why wouldn't it apply in any situation? Think of the phrase *Lean on the Lord and His Love will deliver you from slavery*. We should be mindful not to allow theological fallacies to enter between the lines of this kind of advice. Let's consider the former. The expression of devotion and intensity of relationship with Christ look vary widly by person. How can we presume to know someone has too little or none at all? In the case of the latter, the welcoming of Christ into our lives is a minute to minute process and unfortunately does not guarantee the removal of every obstacle in life, or even to its own end.

We read *be not lukewarm* but what is the boiling point, and is there one? While the outcome of salvation is binary and only known by God, the visible signs of it are as broad and multifaceted as the very life in salvific grace. The problem may lie in the language we often use for Christ's presence in our hearts. We may also suffer the influence of alternative doctrines in our culture. *Accept Christ into your life*. Responding to adversity with these words risks conveying that adversity is proportional to relationship with Christ. Imagine how a person can plummet if they find that they are the cause of their problems despite conviction of a bond with Christ. They then search their hearts for the root of the lie of their love of God. We do not command grace in the form of divine intervention. Unlike love, deliverance does not flow unceasingly into our lives when we lean on Christ.

Conversely, we find in this the truth that we are all broken and lacking God. We all have someplace in life Jesus can fill. We should avoid concluding from the brokenness that even in our fallen state God's presence is finite, either zero or one. Language is lacking. Broken is a static state and has a negative connotation. Something is either broken or not. An item can be fixed to a point where it's partially working but it's still broken at the end of the day. I concede, this is a proper portrayal of fallen humanity, but it is a  pessimistic linguistic view. Why would we willingly talk about our hearts in a way where if the glass is even a drop from full it's still, one drop empty. Doing so negates the blood and water from the heart of Jesus already filling a cup to the brim. It negates it because the heart is missing one more drop for Jesus to fill. What's more, this is the heart, a glass with special properties. There is no limit to the amount of  love present in the heart. God is infinite, even limited to a fraction of Himself, it is a fraction of infinity which is still infinite. Furthermore, if God is infinite we can't reduce his presence in our hearts to measurable terms like full or empty, broken or whole. As fallen we have to admit that we can't achieve a perfect union. We should still rejoice in what resides within the heart now, not admonish for having less than our own.

To bring this back around, we cannot attribute strife in the path of the believer to a lack of virtue or a state of brokenness. We cannot presume God is not in our lives from presuming God would lift all afflictions. We should focus on, and increase the love of and relationship with the Lord we already have, leaning into Christ not expecting deliverance, but accepting acceptance and love itself.
