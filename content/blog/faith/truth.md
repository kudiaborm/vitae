summary: "What does it mean to have a hole in your heart? What if the our hearts can't be filled and that is a good thing?"

The truth shall set you free. The truth shall be a transforming power and you will be a new creation.

The intensity and expression of devotion and freedom look so different from person to person, how can you know whether or not you have it for yourself? I know the truth but I still am held down by something. I am farther than I was but I'm not like this person.

We are told not to be luke warm but what is the boiling point, and is there one? While the outcome of salvation is binary and only known by God, the visible signs of it are as broad and multifaceted as the life they affect.

These things may come from the language we at times use in reference to our hearts. We Catholics believe that salvation is a continuous process that we meander in and out of (or to and away from the edge of) through our lives. So why then do we speak as if our hearts are any different.

I may be alone, but I doubt it. I've heard things like *you are broken, we are all broken*. There are also things along the lines of *there is a hole in our hearts we must let Jesus fill*. While these are true, what follows is usually not the most accurate portrayal of human nature. Broken is a static state and has a negative connotation. Something either is broken or isn't broken. You could say that you could fix something to the point where it's partially working but it's still broken at the end of the day. Why would we willingly talk about our hearts in a way where if the glass is even a drop from full it's still, one drop empty. Why would we negate the blood and water from the heart of Christ already filling a cup to the brim, just because it is missing one more drop for Jesus to fill. 

I'm going to switch to personal pronouns. Our hearts, not just a heart, your heart and my heart, have the capacity to love, know, and even fathom, God who is infinite. Christ has the ability to mysteriously inhabit our hearts. If God is infinite, we can't reduce his presence in our hearts to finite, or even measurable, terms such as full or empty, broken or whole. I concede that as fallen beings we have to admit that we can't achieve a perfect union, but no heart is broken, only filled with Christ to some differing extent, or equal extent but filled in differing chambers.
